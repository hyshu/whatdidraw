# What Did I Draw? - Interactive Drawing Quiz Game

An innovative drawing guessing game built for Reddit using Devvit and Phaser.js. Players create drawings with answers and hints, then watch as others try to guess what was drawn by viewing the drawing process replay in real-time.

## What This Game Is

**What Did I Draw?** is a unique drawing quiz game where creativity meets competition. Players draw pictures with digital tools, set answers and hints, then other players watch the drawing being created stroke-by-stroke and try to guess what it represents. The game combines artistic expression with puzzle-solving in an engaging social environment that runs directly within Reddit posts.

The game features a complete drawing creation system with professional tools, real-time stroke playback for guessing, sophisticated scoring algorithms, per-drawing leaderboards, and personal quiz history tracking. All gameplay happens within Reddit posts using Devvit's web platform, creating a seamless social gaming experience.

### Core Gameplay
- **Create Mode**: Draw on a 360√ó360px digital canvas with professional tools (8 colors, 5 brush sizes, undo functionality) and set answer/hint
- **Quiz Mode**: Watch drawings being created in real-time playback and guess what they represent at any point during the replay
- **Quiz History**: Track your personal quiz performance with detailed history of all answered quizzes, including scores, ranks, and dates
- **Scoring System**: Earn points based on speed and accuracy - fewer strokes viewed and faster guesses earn higher scores
- **Leaderboards**: Compete with other Reddit users for top scores on individual drawings with detailed score breakdowns and user avatars

## What Makes This Game Innovative

### üé¨ **Real-Time Drawing Playback**
Unlike static image guessing games, players watch drawings being created stroke-by-stroke in the exact order and timing they were originally drawn. This creates a unique "time-lapse art" experience where the drawing process itself becomes part of the puzzle.

### üéØ **Strategic Timing System**
Players can guess at any point during the playback, creating strategic decisions: guess early with limited information for maximum points, or wait to see more strokes for a safer but lower-scoring guess.

### üèÜ **Per-Drawing Competition**
Each drawing has its own leaderboard showing the top 5 scores, creating focused competition around individual artworks rather than just global rankings. This encourages players to master specific drawings and compete directly.

### üßÆ **Sophisticated Scoring Algorithm**
Points are calculated using a dual-factor system:
- **Base Score**: (Total strokes - Viewed strokes) √ó 100 (rewards guessing with minimal information)
- **Time Bonus**: max(0, (60 - elapsed seconds) √ó 10) (rewards quick thinking)
- Only the highest score per user per drawing is kept, encouraging repeated attempts to improve

### üì± **Mobile-First Design**
Built with responsive layouts that prevent UI overlap and horizontal scrolling on any screen size (320px to 1920px+). Touch-optimized drawing with proper event handling ensures smooth mobile experience.

### üé® **Community-Driven Content**
Every drawing is created by real Reddit users with their own artistic style, cultural references, and creative interpretations, ensuring endless variety and community-relevant content.

### üîÑ **Seamless Mode Switching**
Players can fluidly switch between creating drawings and playing quizzes with intuitive navigation that maintains context.

### üèÜ **Scoring & Leaderboards**

#### **How Scoring Works**
The game uses a sophisticated dual-factor scoring system that rewards both efficiency and speed:

**Base Score Calculation:**
- Formula: `(Total Strokes - Viewed Strokes) √ó 100`
- Rewards guessing with minimal visual information
- Example: If a drawing has 20 strokes and you guess after seeing 8, you get (20-8) √ó 100 = 1,200 base points

**Time Bonus Calculation:**
- Formula: `max(0, (60 - Elapsed Seconds) √ó 10)`
- Rewards quick thinking and recognition
- Example: If you guess in 25 seconds, you get (60-25) √ó 10 = 350 bonus points

**Total Score:**
- Only awarded for correct guesses
- Total = Base Score + Time Bonus
- Example: 1,200 + 350 = 1,550 total points

**Scoring Features:**
- **Partial Stroke Tracking**: Even partial completion of strokes affects scoring with precise calculation
- **Best Score Only**: Server stores only your highest score per drawing
- **Immediate Feedback**: Detailed modal shows complete score breakdown
- **Strategic Depth**: Balance between waiting for more information vs. time penalty

#### **Leaderboard System**
1. **Per-Drawing Competition**: Each drawing has its own top 5 leaderboard via API
2. **Access Methods**: 
   - Click "Leaderboard" from main menu (requires drawing ID)

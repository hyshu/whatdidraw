# What Did I Draw?

A fun drawing quiz game built as a Reddit app. Create drawings and challenge others to guess what you drew, or play quizzes created by other users!

## Features

### 🎨 Create Drawing

Draw your own quiz for others to solve:

- Use an intuitive canvas with multiple colors and brush sizes
- Add an answer (1-50 characters, required)
- Optionally add a hint (0-100 characters) to help players
- Save your drawing and share it to the subreddit

### 🎮 Play Quiz

Test your guessing skills with drawings from other players:

- View drawings stroke-by-stroke or all at once
- Earn points based on how quickly you guess and how many strokes you viewed
- **Anti-cheat measures**:
  - Answering your own quiz will result in **0 points**
  - Guessing too quickly (without viewing enough strokes) will result in **0 points**
- **Once you answer a quiz, you cannot answer it again** - each quiz can only be attempted once per player

### 🏆 Ranking & Leaderboard

Track your progress and compete with others:

- **Global Ranking**: See the top players across all quizzes
- **Subreddit Ranking**: View rankings specific to each subreddit
- **My History**: Review all the quizzes you've answered with scores and timestamps

# What Did I Draw?

This game was created to enter the [REDDIT AND KIRO: COMMUNITY GAMES CHALLENGE](https://communitygames2025.devpost.com)

[Project Page](https://devpost.com/software/what-did-i-draw-drawing-quiz-game?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)

A Reddit app that lets you create a quiz game where players guess what picture you drew.
Your drawing will be played back stroke by stroke in sequence, and the faster you guess it, the higher your score will be.

## Features

### 🎨 Create Drawing

Can draw pictures for quizzes:

- Use an intuitive canvas with multiple colors and brush sizes
- Once your drawing is complete, write down picture answer and hints and post it!
- After posting, you can also share it on the subreddit, allowing other players to play your quiz.

### 🎮 Play Quiz

If you select “Play Quiz” from within the game rather than via Subreddit, you can play one randomly selected quiz from those posted.

- Stroke by stroke, the picture gradually takes shape.
- If you know what the drawing is, press Pause and enter your answer. The faster you are, the higher your score!
- **Anti-cheat measures**:
  - Guessing too quickly (without viewing enough strokes) will result in **0 points**
  - Also answering your own quiz will result in **0 points**
- **Once you answer a quiz, you cannot answer it again** - each quiz can only be attempted once per player

### 🏆 Ranking & Leaderboard

Track your progress and compete with others:

- **Global Ranking**: See the top players across all quizzes
- **Subreddit Ranking**: View rankings specific to each subreddit
- **My History**: Review all the quizzes you've answered with scores and timestamps

### 📤 Share to Subreddit

After creating a drawing:

- Post your quiz to the subreddit where the app is installed
- Other users can discover and play your quiz
- Build a leaderboard of community-created challenges
